## Demand information sharing in a green supply chain under upstream competition
- with Minghui Xu, Xintong Shi and Hui Shen
- Submit to EJOR
- Highlights
    - Develop a game-theoretic model with two competing manufacturers selling substitutable green products through a common retailer, who has a private demand signal.
    - Examine the incentives of firms to form an information-sharing partnership without or with a side payment contract in both serial and parallel settings.
    - Capture green production technical cost as an important mediator in governing the value of information sharing to each party.
    - Explain the trend that platform tends to provide multiple versions of information sharing toolkits, and sellers are self-incentivized to choose their fits.
