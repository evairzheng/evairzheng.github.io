<!-- 
- Develop a two-period model to explore the dynamic pricing strategy of the firm that sells experience products and the purchasing strategy of consumers who may strategically wait.
- Capture the endogenous time preference of consumers who choose to become strategic by exerting costly effort or to remain myopic with no cost, and examine the effect of such cost on each party.
- Incorporate two-sided quality uncertainty and online reviews to determine the value of information to the firm, consumer surplus, and social welfare by examining the effect of information accuracy. -->
