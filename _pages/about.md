# Short Bio

I am Yiwei Zheng (郑义威), a third-year master student in Wuhan University. 

Currently, <i style="color: red">I am looking for a Ph.D. position in the interface between OM&IS</i>.

My primary research interests are supply chain management and online platform operations. I focus on problems concerning information asymmetry, especially in demand information sharing. I use Microeconomics, Game Theory, and Theory of Industrial Organization to build theoretic models and acquire managerial implications.
