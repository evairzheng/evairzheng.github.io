# About me 🚀
<!-- # Short Bio -->

I am Yiwei Zheng (郑义威). 
I joined as a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Dallas in fall 2025. 
<i style="color: red">Prospective and potential cooperations are highly welcome!</i>

<!-- Currently, <i style="color: red">I am looking for a Ph.D. position in the interface between OM & IS and OM & Marketing</i>. -->

My primary research interests are supply chain management and online platform operations. I focus on problems concerning information asymmetry, especially in demand information sharing. I use Microeconomics, Game Theory, and Theory of Industrial Organization to build theoretic models and to acquire managerial implications.

<!-- 
- Develop a two-period model to explore the dynamic pricing strategy of the firm that sells experience products and the purchasing strategy of consumers who may strategically wait.
- Capture the endogenous time preference of consumers who choose to become strategic by exerting costly effort or to remain myopic with no cost, and examine the effect of such cost on each party.
- Incorporate two-sided quality uncertainty and online reviews to determine the value of information to the firm, consumer surplus, and social welfare by examining the effect of information accuracy. -->
