# About me 🚀
<!-- # Short Bio -->

Greeting! I am Yiwei Zheng (郑义威). 
Currently, I am an Information Systems Ph.D. student in Jindal School of Management, the University of Texas at Dallas. 
<i style="color: red">Prospective and potential cooperations are highly welcome!</i>

<!-- Currently, <i style="color: red">I am looking for a Ph.D. position in the interface between OM & IS and OM & Marketing</i>. -->

My primary research interest lies on economics of IS. I focus on problems concerning online platform operations under information asymmetry. I use Microeconomics, Game Theory, and Theory of Industrial Organization to build theoretic models and to acquire managerial implications.

I am a big fan of [G.E.M.](https://www.instagram.com/gem0816/). She gives me the faith that *"the one who endures to the end, he will be saved."*

<!-- 
- Develop a two-period model to explore the dynamic pricing strategy of the firm that sells experience products and the purchasing strategy of consumers who may strategically wait.
- Capture the endogenous time preference of consumers who choose to become strategic by exerting costly effort or to remain myopic with no cost, and examine the effect of such cost on each party.
- Incorporate two-sided quality uncertainty and online reviews to determine the value of information to the firm, consumer surplus, and social welfare by examining the effect of information accuracy. -->
